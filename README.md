Lab 6: Implementation of System Calls related to Process Creation
Aim: To get the idea of how processes are created using fork() system call.
a. Code-I: For tracing the execution of Parent and Child processes
b. Code-II: For tracing the execution of Parent and Child processes 
c. Code-III: For replacing the code image of Parent and Child processes
Tasks:
1. Creation of n Processes with different Execution Codes
    a. Code I with n child creation
    b. Code II with n child creation
    c. Code III with n child creation
2. Different System Calls of exec() family
	a. exelp() system call
	b. execle() system call
	c. execve() system call
